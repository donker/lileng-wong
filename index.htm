        Lileng was captivated by the art of pottery from an early age. Growing
        up in Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia, her first experience with clay was
        with her father, who worked in a factory that produced red brick.
        Sometimes, during school holidays she would follow her father to the
        factory. “I would be left to play with the clay by myself, while my
        father was busy with his work. Watching him stoke wood into the fire
        holes was enough to fascinate me, although I was too young to understand
        the process at the time”
      </p>

      <p>
        A graphic designer by profession, fuelled by an innate desire to create
        beautiful shapes, she took up part-time pottery lessons at the Kuala
        Lumpur College of Art. Since then there was no turning back in the
        journey from making functional wares to sculpturing. At one point she
        felt clay is just like a messenger to express the feeling she had. “My
        inspiration came from the nature, animals, people. Events that happened
        and the journey through it. It is enough to tell a tale.”
      </p>
      <p>
        During the early years her pieces were mostly influenced by the
        minimalism of Japanese school. The shape, colours, firing technique and
        even the theory behind them. It stirred the imagination as she
        questioned, what is ‘beauty’? What is ‘perfect’?
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2007 Lileng was accepted by the Goshogawara International Woodfire
        Festival as one of the artists to participate in the Tsugaru Kanayama
        Pottery at Goshogawara city, Aomori, located in northern Japan. Her
        ‘Artist in Residency’ stay brought her not just the experience of
        working outside her studio, but it also gave her tremendous respect
        towards the attitude of Japanese craftmanship in art and culture.
        Established by Mr. Ryoji Matsumiya in 1984, the philosophy, or
        motivation, is to promote mutual understanding and greater cooperation
        among potters throughout the world, by encouraging artists to work
        together and share information freely during the month-long program.
        This residency is focused on the exchange of techniques and ideas about
        ceramic art and wood firing.
      </p>
      <p>
        “The most important lesson learned during my stay, beside the techniques
        and ideas, is to have that great attitude towards the whole process of
        creating each piece of work. I remember until now, when it was my turn
        to take care of the kiln for a firing session Mr. Ryoji explaining to me
        how before all the modern technologies, It was common to use sight and
        the colors of the fire to determine the temperature. Hearing the
        crackling sound of woods is to know when to stock the next load of wood.
        That moment was magical, it brought back the memory of my dad firing his
        kiln and I could recall the smell of his workplace…
      </p>
      <p>
        Since then my work took on a different path and faced a different
        dimension. Still often stuck with experiments of shapes and ideas, but
        the experience grew stronger ever...
      </p>
      <p>
        The journey, a treasure…”.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beside working in the studio, Lileng participated in many exhibitions in
        and outside of Malaysia. “The best part of exhibition for my opinion,
        beside to share my works with others was the interpretation of others of
        my works... I often found very inspiring...”
      </p>
      <p>
        Lileng is currently based in Nohèdes, France, high up in the Pyrénées
        Orientales mountains where she has her ceramics studio, but she also
        works from Malaysia and The Netherlands.
